# Generic Algorithm Pathfinder

Implementation of a simplistic generic algorithm pathfinder, written in Python. Made</br>
in relation to an AI class at university, in an attempt to understand the most</br>
effective pathfinding algorithms in video games. 

This generic algorithm was tested and compared against the tried and true A-star</br> 
pathfinding algorithm.</br>

Submitted as an assignment project at Bournemouth University (2022).</br>
